# patchloop
Design files for the PatchLoop PCB

The files patchloop2.kicad_* contain the version with RJ45 jacks on opposite sides. This allows for neat short traces between the jacks.

I needed to rework the files patchloop.kicad_* (jacks on same side) because the first version contained a bug so that only one loop was used effectively.

PCB manufacturer Aisler will directly accept the KiCad file for manufacturing, but you can find zipfiles with the gerbers for both variants in the gerbers/ subdirectory. Any PCB manufacturer (e.g. BetaLayout, JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark) should be able to accept those.
